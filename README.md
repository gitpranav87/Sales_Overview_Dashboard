# Data Analyst Portfolio Project

Welcome to my Data Analyst Portfolio Project repository! This project showcases my expertise in Data Analysis, employing SQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization. The primary goal is to exhibit my proficiency in deriving meaningful insights from a dataset and presenting them in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.

## Project Overview

This portfolio project demonstrates my skills through a detailed analysis of various aspects, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. Utilizing SQL for querying and aggregating data, and Power BI for creating interactive and informative visualizations, the analysis provides a comprehensive view of the dataset. The dataset used is located in the `https://github.com/gitpranav87/Sales_Overview_Dashboard/tree/main/Portfolio_Project(SQL%2BPOWER-BI)` directory, and the analysis is conducted using SQL scripts in the `https://github.com/gitpranav87/Sales_Overview_Dashboard/tree/main/CSV_Files_After_Data_Cleansing_Using_SQL_Queries` folder. The visualizations are created using Power BI, and the corresponding files can be found in the `https://github.com/gitpranav87/Sales_Overview_Dashboard/blob/main/Sales_Overview_Dashboard.pbix` directory.

## Project Structure

- **SQL:** Contains SQL scripts for data extraction, transformation, and analysis. Each script is well-documented to provide a clear understanding of the analysis process.

- **PowerBI:** Includes Power BI files (https://github.com/gitpranav87/Sales_Overview_Dashboard/blob/main/Sales_Overview_Dashboard.pbix) for creating interactive visualizations based on the analyzed data.

- **Data:** Stores the dataset(s) used in the project. Make sure to include or properly link the data files for the scripts and Power BI files to function correctly.

## Getting Started

To explore this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:** Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
